# FlowThroughTensor

FlowThroughTensor is an open-source, cross-platform, lightweight, and efficient C++ library for tensor-based flow modeling and network analysis. It provides robust computational tools for processing flow dynamics within tensor structures, leveraging optimized algorithms for efficient execution.

## Quick Start

- **Tutorial**: A step-by-step demonstration using sample datasets (coming soon).
- **Documentation**: Installation guide, API references, and use cases (coming soon).

## Installation

FlowThroughTensor is built as a standalone C++ package. To use it, follow these steps:

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **C++14 or later**
- **CMake** (for building the project)
- **JSON for Modern C++** (included in the repository)
- **OpenMP** (optional, for parallel processing)

### Build Instructions

To build the package, navigate to the project directory and execute the following:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
