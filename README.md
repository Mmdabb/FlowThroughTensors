FlowThroughTensor

FlowThroughTensor is an open-source, cross-platform, lightweight, and efficient C++ library for tensor-based flow modeling and network analysis. It provides robust computational tools for processing flow dynamics within tensor structures, leveraging optimized algorithms for efficient execution.

Quick Start

Tutorial: A step-by-step demonstration using sample datasets (coming soon).

Documentation: Installation guide, API references, and use cases (coming soon).

Installation

FlowThroughTensor is built as a standalone C++ package. To use it, follow these steps:

Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

C++17 or later

CMake (for building the project)

JSON for Modern C++ (included in the repository)

OpenMP (optional, for parallel processing)

Build Instructions

To build the package, navigate to the project directory and execute the following:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This will generate the executable for FlowThroughTensor.

Test Dataset

Sample test datasets and example scripts can be found in the test folder.

Inputs:

network.json: Defines the network structure.

flow_data.csv: Provides initial conditions for flow calculations.

settings.json: Configuration parameters.

Outputs:

tensor_output.json: Processed tensor data.

flow_results.csv: Computed flow values for analysis.

Usage Example

Basic Execution:

./FlowThroughTensor input/network.json input/flow_data.csv output/tensor_output.json
